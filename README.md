## ArrayList Cloning Shallow VS Deep Copy
This project demonstrate the difference between shallow and depp copy in Java using ArrayList and custom classes (Int2 , Int3).

## 📌Overview
- Shallow Copy : Copies the refernce of objects. Both lists share the same underlying objects.
- Deep Copy : Creates independent copies of objects so changes in the one does not affect the other.

## 👩‍💻 Code Structure
- Int2 : A simple class wrapping an integer.
- Int3 : An extended version with cloning functionality.
- Main : Demonstrate :
  - Creating an ArrayList of Int2 objects.
  - Performing shallow cloning (clone()).
  - Implementing deep cloning by copying each object individually.

## Key Concepts
- Heap & Stack memory refernces
- Object cloning in java
- Difference between shallow and deep copy.
